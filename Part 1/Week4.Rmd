# Lab 4: Austin City Limits

![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/19b74cbd25c0272359eb5f8eb3687ca9/asset-v1:UTAustinX+UT.7.11x+2T2017+type@asset+block/music.jpg)

Known as the “Live Music Capital of the World,” Austin, Texas is also home to the longest-running music series in American television history, Austin City Limits.  This dataset includes data on a sample of musicians that performed live on the PBS television series Austin City Limits over the last 10 years.  Data on each artist include measures of commercial popularity, such as the number of social media followers on Twitter or Facebook, and their success in winning a Grammy Music Award. 

Primary Research Question

For artists age 30 or older, do female artists play different kinds of music on Austin City Limits than male artists?

Check the Data

Let's begin by examining our data in R.

1. Open RStudio. Make sure you've installed the current version of the SDSFoundations package.
2. Type library(SDSFoundations) This will automatically load the data for the labs. 
3.Type `acl <- AustinCityLimits` This will assign the data to your Workspace.
4. Look at the spreadsheet view of the data to answer the following questions.

Alternatively, you can use follow the steps in the "Importing a Data Frame" R tutorial video, and use the AustinCityLimits.csv file. (Right-click and "Save As.") Make sure to name the dataframe "acl" when importing.

1. Open RStudio.
2. Click on "Import Dataset" button at the top of the workspace window. Choose "from text file."
3. Click on the location of the AustinCityLimits.csv file you just downloaded.
4. Click on the AustinCityLimits.csv file. Then, click Upload.
5. Look at the spreadsheet view of the data to answer the following questions.
```{r}
library(SDSFoundations)
acl <- AustinCityLimits
nrow(acl)
table(acl[0:10,]$Grammy)

Reflect on the Method

Which method should we be using for this analysis and why?


3. We will generate a contingency table of genre and gender to help us with this analysis. Why?


The table will show us how many male and female artists played each type of music. correct
The table will show us the theoretical probability of each type of music appearing on ACL Live.
The table will help us identify which cases should be deleted.
4. We will compare marginal and conditional probabilities to determine if female and male artists tend to play different kinds of music. Why?


We want to determine whether female artists prefer jazz.
We want to describe the distribution of a single categorical variable.
We want to determine if two categorical variables are independent or not. correct


Prepare for the Analysis

Primary Research Question

For artists age 30 or older, do female artists play different kinds of music on Austin City Limits than male artists?

Breakdown Your Analysis

Let's break this analysis into its required steps:

1. Create a subset of the data for artists age 30 or older.
2. Create a table to show the marginal distribution for each variable.  
3. Create a contingency table to show the conditional distribution for gender and genre.  
4. Make a bar chart to better visualize how many male and female artists played in each genre.
5. Calculate P(A):  the probability of each type of music (genre) being played.
6. Calculate P(A|B):  the probability of each genre, given the artist’s gender.
7. Interpret what these probabilities tell us about the relationship between genre and gender. 

Here is the code you will use:
```{r}
#Subset the data for artists age 30 or older
older <-acl[acl$Age>=30,]

# Create tables of marginal distributions
genre <- table(older$Genre)
genre
gender <- table(older$Gender)
gender

# Create contingency table 
twoway <- table(older$Gender,older$Genre)
twoway

# Visualize the counts
barplot(twoway, legend=T, beside=T)

# Calculate P(A): the probability of each genre being played
prop.table(genre)

# Calculate P(A|B): the probability of each genre being played, given the artist’s gender
prop.table(twoway,1)
```

2) This code produces a bar chart with both a legend and side-by-side bars for each gender:

What would the code look like if we wanted to keep the legend but stack the bars (instead of set them side-by-side)?


barplot(twoway, beside=TRUE)
barplot(twoway)
barplot(twoway, legend=TRUE) correct


problem

3) This line of code will produce four values, one for each genre of music:
prop.table(genre)

What value should you get if you sum the four values together?

4) What does the value "1" refer to in this line of code:
prop.table(twoway,1)

Hint: Go back and look at the comment line.


The number 1 references the first variable (gender) listed in the contingency table code. correct
The number 1 refers to the first kind of question we typically ask of a contingency table.
The number 1 refers to the fact that we typically code gender as (0,1) for (male,female).

problem
1/1 point (graded)
5) Suppose we ran the following code to find conditional probabilities. What error has caused the prop.table function to not work? (You may want to examine the dataset in R for help.)

acl <- AustinCityLimits
View(acl)
gender_grammy <- table(acl$Gender, acl$Grammy)
prop.table(acl$Gender, acl$Grammy, 1)

Error in prop.table(acl$Gender, acl$Grammy, 1) : unused argument (1)


The prop.table function needs a table as an argument. correct
There is no "Gender" variable in our dataset.
The "Grammy" variable in our dataset is not capitalized.
We have used two quantitative variables instead of categorical variables.

Write Your Conclusions

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

The music played on Austin City Limits was grouped into four genres, including Country, Jazz, Rock and Singer-Songwriter. We wanted to examine only those artists who were age 30 or older. correctRock was the most frequently played genre, performed by  correct59.8 % of the Austin City Limits artists. Among female artists, however, only correct32.0 % of the artists played Rock music. This difference between the marginal and correctconditional probabilities suggests that gender and genre

Primary Research Question

Among male artists, is there an association between winning a Grammy and the genre of music that he plays?

Analysis

Let’s break this question down into the different descriptive statistics that you will need to construct your answer.  Be sure that your R output includes all of the following components. 

1. Subset the data (males only).
2. Create a table to show the marginal distributions for Genre and Grammy.
3. Create a contingency table to show the conditional distribution for Genre and Grammy.
4. Make a bar chart to better visualize how many artists in each Genre received a Grammy.
5. Calculate P(A):  the probability of winning a Grammy.
6. Calculate P(A|B): the probability of winning Grammy, given the artist's Genre.
7. Interpret what these probabilities tell us about the relationship between Genre and winning a Grammy.

2.  Generate a table to show the number of "popular" artists within each age group.

Use the "AustinCityLimits.csv" dataset to answer the following questions.  Instructions for installing "AustinCityLimits.csv" can be found under the Examine the Data unit in this week's Pre-Lab section.
