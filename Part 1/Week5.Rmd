# Lab 4: Track and Field World Records

![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/c4823f5ba887fd530127c568af979572/asset-v1:UTAustinX+UT.7.11x+2T2017+type@asset+block/track.jpg)
Every four years, track and field athletes take the world stage at the Summer Olympics.  Some of the most exciting events during each Olympics are those in which athletes push the limits of their sport, breaking their own personal best records, national records, or even world records.  We have compiled the world record times for track events like the 100m dash and record distances for field events like the shotput into a single dataset.  This dataset includes information on the person who broke the record, his/her nationality, where the record was broken, and the year it was broken.  Note that not all world records are broken during the Olympics, with many occurring in regional or national competitions.

Primary Research Question

How has the men’s shotput world record changed over time?  What about the women’s world record?

Check the Data

Let's begin by examining our data in R.

1. Open RStudio. Make sure you've installed the current version of the SDSFoundations package.
2. Type library(SDSFoundations) This will automatically load the data for the labs. 
3.Type WR <- WorldRecords This will assign the data to your Workspace.
4. Look at the spreadsheet view of the data to answer the following questions.

Alternatively, you can use follow the steps in the "Importing a Data Frame" R tutorial video, and use the WorldRecords.csv file. (Right-click and "Save As.") Make sure to name the dataframe "WR" when importing.

1. Open RStudio.
2. Click on "Import Dataset" button at the top of the workspace window. Choose "from text file."
3. Click on the location of the WorldRecords.csv file you just downloaded.
4. Click on the WorldRecords.csv file. Then, click Upload.
5. Look at the spreadsheet view of the data to answer the following questions.
```{r}
library(SDSFoundations)

WR <- WorldRecords

table(WR$Event)

WR[WR$Athlete == "Usain Bolt",]

Reflect on the Method

Which method should we be using for this analysis and why?


3. For each sex, we will begin our analysis by generating a scatterplot of shotput distance and year. Why?


The scatterplot will show us how many athletes broke the shotput world record.
The scatterplot will show us how much the men's and the women's records differ.
The scatterplot will show us if these two numeric variables are linearly related. correct
4. What will we be able to determine once we fit a linear model to this shotput world record data?


We will be able to report the average rate of change in world record shotput distance per year. correct
We can determine if men throw a shotput significantly farther than women ever will.
We can say how often the world record for men and women's shotput is broken.


Primary Research Question

How has the men’s shotput world record changed over time?  What about the women’s world record?

Breakdown Your Analysis

Let's break this analysis into its required steps:

1. Create a subset of the dataset that contains only the World Record cases for men’s shotput.
2. Create a subset that contains only the World Record cases for women's shotput. 
3. Create a scatterplot of year and record shotput distance: one for men and one for women.  
4. Confirm from these plots that a linear model is appropriate.  
5. Run a linear model for each event and then interpret the results.

Here is the code you will use:
```{r}
#Subset the data
menshot <- WR[WR$Event=='Mens Shotput',]
womenshot <- WR[WR$Event=='Womens Shotput',] 

#Create scatterplots
plot(menshot$Year,menshot$Record,main='Mens Shotput World Records',xlab='Year',ylab='World Record Distance (m)',pch=16)
plot(womenshot$Year,womenshot$Record,main='Womens Shotput World Records',xlab='Year',ylab='World Record Distance (m)',pch=16)

5) Suppose we wanted to subset our dataset for only world records that were from 1990 and later. What caused the error below? (You may want to examine the dataset in R for help.)

Error in [.data.frame (WR, Year >= 1990, ) : object 'Year' not found
We forgot to tell R to look in the "recent" dataset for "Year" (ie. recent$Year).
We forgot to tell R to look in the "WR" dataset for "Year" (ie. WR$Year).> correct
We need quotation marks around 1990 even though it is numerical.
The "Year" variable is spelled differently in our dataset.

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

Based on scatterplots of the men’s and women’s world record shotput distance, both of these events follow a strong, correctpositive linear relationship over time. The men’s world record distance increases by an average of  correct0.134 meters per year, while the women’s record distance increases by an average of correct0.234 meters per year. Because the intercept estimate is the value of the record distance when correctyear is equal to 0, it is not interpretable in the context of the problem. Both linear models fit the data well, with R-squared values for the men’s and women’s models equal to correct0.941 and correct0.962 , respectively.

Write Your Conclusion

Based on scatterplots of the men’s and women’s world record mile event, both of these events follow a strong,  correctnegative relationship over time. For both groups, the assumption of linearity appears to be satisﬁed. The men’s world record mile time decreases by an average of correct.393 seconds per year, while the women's record distance decreases by an average of  correct.973 seconds per year. Because the  correctintercept estimate is the value of the record time when year is equal to 0, it is not interpretable in the context of the problem. Both linear models ﬁt the data well, with R-squared values for the men's and women's models equal to correct.977 and  correct.896 , respectively. For the men's world record, 97.7% of the  correctvariance is explained by the linear model of year, while for the female world record, 89.6% of the  correctvariance in performance can be explained by the linear model of year.
