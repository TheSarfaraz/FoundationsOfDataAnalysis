# Lab 3: Professional Bull Riding
![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/6820e887661d68aa4d51060d5c8fb329/asset-v1:UTAustinX+UT.7.11x+2T2017+type@asset+block/bull.jpg)
Over 1,200 bull riders from around the world are members of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR). They compete in more than 300 PBR-affiliated bull riding events per year. In the American tradition, the rider must stay atop the bucking bull for a full eight seconds. This data set includes information about the top-ranked bull riders for 2013.  Rankings are based on a system which awards points for qualified rides at events throughout the season. More information is available at: http://www.pbr.com/en/bfts/standings/riders.aspx.

Primary Research Question

For the 2013 season, Is there a linear relationship between how often a rider placed in the Top 10 and the number of times he stayed on his bull for a full 8 seconds?

We need to identify how many cases are in the dataset.

Primary Research Question

For the 2013 season, Is there a linear relationship between how often a rider places in the Top 10 and the number of times he stayed on his bull for a full 8 seconds?

Breakdown Your Analysis

Let's break this analysis into its required steps:

1. Create a subset of the data which contains only those riders that have participated in at least one event in 2013.
2. Create a scatterplot of the two variables of interest.
3. Check to see that the relationship is linear.  Plot a line of best fit as a guide.
4. If the relationship is linear, calculate the correlation coefficient.
5. Carefully examine any outliers.
6. Interpret what the correlation says about the linear relationship between these variables. 

Here is the code you will use:
```{r}
#Subset for riders that participated in at least one event in 2013
new_bull <- bull[bull$Events13  > 0 ,]

# Visualize and describe the first variable of interest
hist(new_bull$Rides13)
fivenum(new_bull$Rides13)
mean(new_bull$Rides13)
sd(new_bull$Rides13)

# Visualize and describe the second variable of interest
hist(new_bull$Top10_13)
fivenum(new_bull$Top10_13)
mean(new_bull$Top10_13)
sd(new_bull$Top10_13)

# Create a scatterplot
plot(new_bull$Rides13,new_bull$Top10_13)

# Add line of best fit
abline(lm(new_bull$Top10_13~new_bull$Rides13))

# Calculate the correlation coefficient
cor(new_bull$Rides13,new_bull$Top10_13)

# Create a correlation matrix 
vars <- c("Top10_13", "Rides13")
cor(new_bull[,vars])

4. A correlation matrix allows you to calculate multiple correlation coefficients at a time. Here, we are only asking for the correlation between Rides13 and Top10_13. If you wanted to include other variables as well, how would you do that?

`# Create a correlation matrix`
`vars <-c("Top10_13", "Rides13")`
`cor(new_bull[,vars])`


Eliminate the line cor(new_bull[,vars]), because a correlation is only between two variables.
Add the variable names to the "vars" object. correct
You couldn't do that. You would have to run separate correlation matrices for each pair of variables.

5. In the above scatterplot, why does the line of best fit seem to not be going through the center of the scatterpot? (Refer to the code below and the dataset in R for help.)


The "Events" and "BuckOuts" variables should be switched in the abline command. correct
The "O"should not be capitalized in "BuckOuts".
The plot was created with two variables that are categorical.
The line of best fit goes through the plot accurately.

`which(new_bull$Top10_13==2 & new_bull$Rides13==22)`

5. After looking at the data for this rider, can you explain why he has placed in the Top 10 so few times?


He weighs more than 200 pounds, so he is too heavy.
He had only 12 rides, so he was not able to be competitive for the Top 10.
He did not participate in any events during the 2013 season.
His ride percentage was only about 33%, which wasn't high enough to place him in the Top 10. correct

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

There is a strong  correct linear relationship between the number of 8-second rides a bull rider completed and the total number of times he made it in the Top 10 after the 2013 season, (r =  correct ). The average number of rides for these bull riders was around correct .There were no significant outliers. One rider appeared to have placed in the top-10 rankings only twice, despite an above-average number of rides. Upon closer inspection, we could see that he did not have a very high  correct which might account for his few appearances in the Top 10.

Review of Correlation

In this lab, you will use correlation to answer a question of interest. Let's start by remembering why we use correlation.

1a. A correlation can tell us:


how much one variable causes another to vary.
the direction and strength of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables. correct
the frequency of scores for a quantitative variable.
the number of data points in a scatterplot that are outliers.


1b. Look at the scatterplot below. Select the answer that best describes what would happen to the value of the correlation coefficient rxy if the circled point were removed from the analysis.

problem
8/8 points (graded)
Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

An initial examination of the relationships between Ride Percentage (RidePer) and Earnings, and Cup Points (CupPoints) and Earnings showed that Cup Points had the  correct relationship to Earnings. Ride Percentage and Earnings showed a correlation value of  correct while Cup Points and Earnings had a correlation value of  correct . Visual examination showed an  correct in both relationships—a rider who has earned over 1 million dollars. Removal of this increased the initial relationship: Ride Percentage and Earnings now had a correlation value of  correct and Cup Points and Earnings had a correlation value of  correct .  correct still had the higher relationship to Earnings. Visual examination showed a  correct for both Ride Percentage and Cup Points, indicating the correct use of the correlation coefficient.



Question 1

During a professional bull-riding event, riders usually attempt to ride a bull three or more times.  This means that they can record a "ride" (successfully staying on the bull) multiple times in the same event.

Subset the dataset for riders that had at least 1 ride in the 2014 season. Call this dataset new_bull.
Create a new variable or vector for the average number of rides per event for each bull rider in the new_bull dataset:
`RidesPerEvent14 <- new_bull$Rides14/new_bull$Events14`
Make a histogram of your "rides per event" variable and find the five-number summary for your "rides per event" variable.
```{r}
newBull <-bull[bull$Rides14 > 0,]
RidesPerEvent14 <- newBull$Rides14 / newBull$Events14
