The World Bank is a data collection of information on all the world’s countries. Data is collected by country, and include items such as total population, CO2 emissions, and the number of mobile device subscriptions. We will examine some of the trends in this dataset and interpret the parameters of the fitted models to best describe the change over time.

Primary Research Question

What model best describes the first decade of internet usage (1990-1999) in the United States? Which model is a better long-term fit?

Primary Research Question

What model best describes the first decade of internet usage (1990-1999) in the United States? Which model is a better long-term fit?

Breakdown Your Analysis

Let's break this analysis into its required steps:

1. Create a subset of the dataset that contains only the information for the United States.
2. Create a subset of the US data that contains only the years 1990 to 1999.  
3. Use a function to fit both an exponential and a logistic model to the data.  
4. Using each model, predict the number of internet users in 2006. 
5. Compare the size of the residuals for 2006 to determine which model appears to have better long-term fit.

Note:  In this lab, you will be creating three new subsets of data by constraining the original world dataset. The names of these three datasets are shown in the table below.  A brief description of each is also provided to help you navigate the R code.

name	description of dataset
us	contains only the USA data from the world dataset
us_select	contains only the USA data for the years 1990 and beyond          
us_select_10    	contains only the USA data for the years 1990 - 1999
Here is the code you will use:
```{r}
# Subset data for just the United States and name the new data frame "us"
us <- world[world$Country.Code == "USA",]

# Select the years from 1990 and name the new data frame "us_select"
us_select <- us[us$year >= 1990, ]

# Create a new variable in our datset called internet.mil to make the number of users more interpretable (into millions)
us_select$internet.mil <- us_select$internet.users / 1000000

# Create a new variable in our dataset called time that represents "years since 1990"
us_select$time <- us_select$year - 1990

# Select the first 10 years (from 1990 to 1999) and name the new data frame "us_select_10"
us_select_10 <- us_select[us_select$time < 10,]

# Use a function to fit an exponential and logistic model for 1990-1999
expFit(us_select_10$time, us_select_10$internet.mil)
logisticFit(us_select_10$time, us_select_10$internet.mil)

# Based on the prior model parameters, predict the number of internet users in 2006
e <- expFitPred(us_select_10$time, us_select_10$internet.mil, 16)

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

correctBoth the logistic and exponential models do/does a fairly good job of fitting the pattern of internet usage in the United States from 1990-1999, as shown by R-squared values  correctgreater than 0.95. If we look ahead to 2006, however, we see that the  correctlogistic model has a better long-term fit. This model predicted  correct127.5 million users in 2006, with a smaller residual of  correct78.2 million. The  correctexponential model predicted far more users than there really were. It appears that the number of new internet users grew rapidly at first but then began to level off over time.

Review of Exponential and Logistic Models

In this lab, you will use exponential and logistic models to answer a question of interest. Let's start by remembering how we approach a modeling problem.


1) When choosing between two models with very similar R2 values, what additional statistic should you examine to help you select the best-fitting model?


The sum of squares
The residuals correct
The value of r
the mean and standard deviation of the dependent variable
2) Which parameter represents the rapidity of growth (or change) in both the exponential and the logistic model?


a
t
C
b correct
3) Most biological data will follow a logistic growth model. Why?


The logistic model does a better job at estimating the initial growth rate than the exponential model.
The logistic model never decays; it only increases with time.
The logistic model takes into account the fact that most growth does not continue indefinitely. correct

Analyze the Data

Primary Research Question

Denmark is a high-income country in Europe of about 5.5 million people. What is the best-fitting model for growth of internet usage in Denmark since 1990?  

Analysis

Let’s break this question down into the different descriptive statistics that you will need to construct your answer.  Be sure that your R output includes all of the following components. 

1. Create a variable that represents proportion of the population using the internet (internet users divided by population).
2. Create a subset of the data that only contains data from 1990 onward.
3. Create a new variable that is "years since 1990". 
4. Create two new data frame for the country of interest.
5. Determine the best-fitting model (exponential or logistic) for internet usage in each country from 1990 onward.

```{r}
# Subset data for just the United States and name the new data frame "us"
denmark <- world[world$Country.Code == "DNK",]

# Select the years from 1990 and name the new data frame "us_select"
denmark_select <- denmark[denmark$year >= 1990, ]

# Create a new variable in our datset called internet.mil to make the number of users more interpretable (into millions)
denmark_select$proportion <- denmark_select$internet.users / denmark_select$population

# Create a new variable in our dataset called time that represents "years since 1990"
denmark_select$time <- denmark_select$year - 1990

# Select the first 10 years (from 1990 to 1999) and name the new data frame "us_select_10"
#denmark_select_10 <- denmark_select[denmark_select$time < 10,]

# Use a function to fit an exponential and logistic model for 1990-1999
expFit(denmark_select$time, denmark_select$proportion)
logisticFit(denmark_select$time, denmark_select$proportion)

# Based on the prior model parameters, predict the number of internet users in 2006

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

After using both an exponential and a logistic function to model Denmark's growth of internet usage since 1990, we found that the  correctlogistic model fit better with a high R-squared value of  correct.995 , compared to an R-squared value of correct.800 for the exponential model. In addition, it is visually clear from the graphs that the logistic model fit the observed data better than the exponential model. All of this suggests that we should trust predictions from the logistic model more than predictions from the exponential model. The exponential model suggests that in 1990, there was a predicted proportion of  incorrect.00585 of Denmark's population that used internet, with the proportion of internet users increasing by a factor of  correct1.347 every year after 1990, on average. The logistic model shows that the predicted  correctcarrying capacity of the proportion of people who use internet in Denmark was .8967. Since the logistic model fits better, the proportion of internet users in Denmark will probably eventually correctlevel off rather than continuing to grow exponentially.

Based on the residuals of both models, what conclusion would you reach? Fill in the missing blanks.

The better fit statistic of the  correct model suggests that the number of new flu cases will  correct . Based on this model, we would expect the maximum number of flu cases in the 2009 season to be:  correct . However,  correct does a perfect job of predicting future cases by Day 14. We will need to observe how the data changes  correct to determine how the model needs to be adjusted.

Question 4

4. A group of hedgehogs was released in the south‐Austin area. Each year, the size of the population was recorded. Their population growth over time was modeled with a logistic growth curve. The model fit was 0.972.
