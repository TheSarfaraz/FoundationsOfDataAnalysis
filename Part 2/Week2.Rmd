Over 1,200 bull riders from around the world are members of Professional Bull Riders (PBR) and compete in the more than 300 PBR affiliated bull riding events per year. This data set includes information about the top 50 ranked bull riders for the 2013, according to the PBR standings reported in July of 2013. Rankings are based on a system which awards points for qualified rides at events throughout the season.

Primary Research Question

The average American adult man weighs 190 pounds.  Do professional bull riders from the US weigh the same?

Check the Data

Let's begin by examining our data in R.

1. Open RStudio. Make sure you've installed the SDSFoundations package.
2. Type library(SDSFoundations). This will automatically load the data for the labs. 
3.Type bull <- BullRiders. This will assign the data to your Workspace.
4. Look at the spreadsheet view of the data to answer the following questions.

Alternatively, you can use follow the steps in the "Importing a Data Frame" R tutorial video, and use the BullRiders.csv file. (Right-click and "Save As.") Make sure to name the dataframe "bull" when importing.

1. Open RStudio.
2. Click on "Import Dataset" button at the top of the workspace window. Choose "from text file."
3. Click on the location of the BullRiders.csv file you just downloaded.
4. Click on the BullRiders.csv file. Then, click Upload.
5. Look at the spreadsheet view of the data to answer the following questions.

```{r}

Reflect on the Method

Which method should we be using for this analysis and why?

2a. We will use a one-sample t-test to help us answer this lab question. Why?


We want to compare the average weight of these bull riders to a claimed value. correct
We want to compare the distributions of two numeric variables.
We want to see how much professional bull riders weigh.
We want to determine if there is any kind of relationship between a rider's weight and his PBR rank.
2b. We want to test a hypothesis that professional bull riders weigh 190 pounds on average. What will the null hypothesis look like for this one-sample t-test?


μ=190 pounds correct
The average weight of a bull rider in this sample is not 190 pounds.
The average weight of a bull-rider in this sample is 190 pounds.
μ≠190 incorrect
2c. The formula to calculate a t-statistic is below. What does the denominator of this test tell us?

t=(x¯-μ)/SE?


the center of the sampling distribution
the difference you would expect, based on chance alone correct
the sample size
the size of a statistically significant difference

Primary Research Question

The average American adult man weighs 190 pounds.  Do professional bull riders in the US weigh the same?

Breakdown Your Analysis

Let's break this analysis into its required steps:

1. Create a data frame for the US bull riders, and then calculate the sample mean and standard deviation for the weight of the bull-riders.
2. Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of bull-riders' weights.  
3. Confirm the assumptions of a one-sample t-test
4. Run the t-test and interpret the results.
Here is the code you will use:
```{r}
#Select bull riders from the US
USA <-bull[bull$Country=="USA",]

# Summarize the bull rider weights
mean(USA$Weight)
sd(USA$Weight)

# Visualize the weight distribution
hist(USA$Weight, main='Histogram of US Bull Rider Weights',xlab='Weight (lbs)')

# Run the single sample t-test

Error: unexpected symbol in "hist(bull$YearBorn, main = 'Histogram of Bull Rider Weights, xlab= 'Weight"


The "YearBorn" variable is spelled differently in our dataset.
We cannot have parentheses around lbs in the histogram statement.
We forgot to create a label for the y-axis.
We used too few quotation marks in the histogram statement. correct

Review of the One-Sample t-Test

In this lab, you will use a one-sample t-test to answer a question of interest. Let's start by remembering why we use hypothesis tests.

1a. What is the goal of a hypothesis test?


To explain a causal relationship, such as "What makes that particular bull harder to ride?"
To identify what the true value of a population mean is, based on the sample mean.
To determine if the sample data is consistent, or inconsistent, with the null hypothesis about the population. correct
To prove that the alternative hypothesis is true.
1b. For your test result to be considered trustworthy, your data must meet the assumptions for a one-sample t-test. Which of the following is not an assumption of this test?


The data was collected voluntarily from all subjects. correct
The sample is made up of independent observations.
The population distribution should be nearly Normal, or the sample should be large.
A random sample is used.

## Problem Set

Question 1

How much money do professional bull riders earn by participating in an event?

1. Create a new variable that equals the "average earnings per event" in the 2012 season for each bull rider in the dataset. Call this new variable "earnings_per"

2. Make a histogram of your "earnings per event" variable.

3. Use this data to answer the following questions.

Use the "BullRiders.csv" dataset to answer the following questions.  Instructions for installing "BullRiders.csv" can be found under the Examine the Data unit in this week's Pre-Lab section.
```{r}
earnings_per <- bull$Earnings12 / bull$Events12

When a variable is highly skewed, we can transform the data into a shape that allows us to conduct our analysis. 

1. Create a new variable that is the log of your "earnings_per" variable.  

2. Here is the code to make a log transformation of a variable: 

bull$newvariable <- log(bull$originalvariable)

3. Now use this new variable to answer the following questions.

1b. Make a histogram of this log-transformed variable. Notice how the distribution shape has changed. Can we reliably calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean of this transformed variable?

No, the distributuon of the log-transformed variable still shows severe positive skew.
No, the distributuon of the log-transformed variable is negatively skewed.
