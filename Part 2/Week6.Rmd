# Pre-lab 6: Medical School Quality of Life
![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/ae424bae893d9fb9c0587b0cd914962d/asset-v1:UTAustinX+UT.7.21x+2T2017+type@asset+block/med_school.jpg)

In a 2015 study, Tempski and associates examined a measurement they called Quality of Life among medical school students in Brazilian medical schools. They borrowed measurement scales from the World Health Organization, the Dundee Ready Education Environment Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory to assess the dependent variable in potential relation to a number of predictor variables.

Primary research questions

1) Can you confirm the claim that Beck Depression Inventory score is a significant predictor of Overall Quality of Life among students enrolled in the Clinical Sciences program?

2) For students enrolled in the Clinical Sciences program, examine the effects of DREEM: Social Self Perception, DREEM: Academic Self Perception, Resilience, BDI, and Age on Med School Quality of Life?

Reflect on the Method

Which method should we be using for this analysis and why?

3a. We will use Multiple Linear Regression to answer our Second Primary Research Question. Why?


We want to determine if the category of Med School changes the Quality of Life.
We want to examine multiple predictors of a single quantitative outcome. correct
We have just two quantitative variables and want to examine their relationship.
3b. For both question models, we'll need to examine diagnostic plots. Why?


We want to confirm the mean of the outcome variable.
We need to assess the assumptions of the model, and look for potential outliers. correct
We want to determine the average variance for each level of Med School Group.

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

To answer our primary research questions about Clinical Sciences med students, we conducted two primary tests: a simple linear regression and a multiple linear regression. First, we investigated the claimed effect of Beck Depression Inventory score on Overall Quality of Life. There was a correctnegative correlation between Beck Depression Inventory score and Overall Quality of Life. The corresponding model showed a  incorrectsignificant simple slope for Beck Depression Inventory (t(489)=  correct-8.935 , p<0.05) indicating that as the Beck Depression Inventory score increases, the Overall Quality of Life score  correctdecreases 

The multiple linear regression examined the impact of DREEM: Social Self Perception, DREEM: Academic Self Perception, Resilience, BDI, and Age on Med School Quality of Life. Overall, the model was  correctsignificant (F(5,485)=  correct48.59 , p<.05), and could account for  correct33.37% of the variance in the outcome (Adjusted R2=  correct32.69% ). The best predictor of Med School Quality of Life was  correctDREEM: Social Self Perception which could account for a unique proportion of variance in the outcome of  correct8.23%.
