# Pre-Lab 5: Top Grossing Films
![Films](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/8b9323561dbe43a1245e396b3f3ed322/asset-v1:UTAustinX+UT.7.21x+2T2017+type@asset+block/mr._jones.jpg)
Like most Americans, people in Austin are fascinated with cinema.  The American film industry has captured the attention of audiences around the world, making film a multibillion-dollar-a-year industry.  Most of the top-grossing films of all times have been produced by the same five major studios:  20th-Century Fox, Paramount, Sony Pictures, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros.  This data set focuses on the 151 films made by these studios that made the list of the 245 top-grossing films of all times, as determined by source Box Office Mojo.  For each of the films, data includes film genre, MPAA rating, measures of film critic and user rankings, and production outcomes such as budget, time in theaters and amount grossed.


Primary Research Questions

1. Does a film’s rating (PG, PG-13, or R) impact its cost to produce?
2. Does a film’s rating (PG, PG-13, or R) influence its IMDB score?

Reflect on the Method

Which method should we be using for this analysis and why?

3a. We will use ANOVA to help us answer each of these questions. Why?


We want to determine if the category to which a film belongs has an impact on some other quantitative measure. correct
We believe the difference in scores given by film critics and IMDB users is significant.
We cannot compare the means of these groups using any other method because the groups are related.
3b. We will conduct post-hoc tests, specifically Tukey’s HSD, if the result of either ANOVA is significant. Why?


We want to confirm that the assumptions of ANOVA have been met.
We want to locate which group means are different from each other. correct
We want to determine the average score for each category.


Primary Research Questions

1. Does a film’s rating (PG, PG-13, or R) impact its cost to produce?
2. Does a film’s rating (PG, PG-13, or R) influence its IMDB score?

Breakdown Your Analysis

Let's break this analysis into its required steps:

For each ANOVA:

1. Identify the number of films in each rating group (PG, PG-13, R). 
2. Compute the mean and standard deviation of the variable of interest for each group.
3. Create boxplots to help visualize group differences and check test assumptions.
4. Run ANOVA.
5. If the F statistic is significant, run a Tukey HSD test to determine which groups are different.

Here is the code you will use:
```{r}
# Show how many films are in each group
table(film$Rating)
```

Question 1
```{r}
# Calculate avg film budget of each group
aggregate(Budget~Rating,film,mean)

# Calculate sd of film budget within each group
aggregate(Budget~Rating,film,sd)

# Visualize the group means and variability
boxplot(film$Budget~film$Rating, main= "Film Budgets by Rating",
ylab= "Budget", xlab= "MPAA Rating")

# Run ANOVA
modelbud <- aov(film$Budget~film$Rating)
summary(modelbud)

# Run post-hoc test if F statistic is significant
TukeyHSD(modelbud)

```

Question 2
```{r}
# Calculate avg IMDB score of each group
aggregate(IMDB~Rating,film,mean)

#Calculate sd of IMDB scores within each group
aggregate(IMDB~Rating,film,sd)

# Visualize the group means and variability
boxplot(film$IMDB~film$Rating, main= "IMDB Scores by Rating",
           ylab= "IMDB Score", xlab= "MPAA Rating")

# Run ANOVA
modelscore <- aov(film$IMDB~film$Rating)
summary(modelscore)

# Run post-hod text if F statistic is significant
TukeyHSD(modelscore)
```

```

Warning messages:
1: In model.response(mf, "numeric") : using type = "numeric" with a factor response will be ignored
2: In Ops.factor(y, z$residuals) : - not meaningful for factors


We should have run a Chi Square Test of Independence. correct
We cannot store the aov() function information into "modelRating."
One of the variable names is spelled differently in our dataset.
We should have run a two-sample t-test.

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

This analysis examined 151 top-grossing films produced by five major studios. The average cost of a film was found to vary depending on its MPAA rating (F=  correct13.1 , p < .05). In a Tukey HSD test,  correctPG-13 films were shown to cost significantly more on average ($127M) than PG films ($  correct75 M). PG-13 films fell just shy of costing significantly more than  correctR rated films (p=.053). The average IMDB score of a film  correctdoes not appear to vary with MPAA rating (F=0.3, p=  correct0.74 ). The average ratings for all three categories of film were close to  correct7 on a scale of 1-10.

Review of ANOVA

In this lab, you will use ANOVA to answer a question of interest. Let's start by remembering why we use ANOVA.

1a. What is the goal of an ANOVA analysis?


to determine if significant mean differences exist between multiple groups correct
to identify the distribution of counts across three or more groups
to compare the variability of scores in two different groups
1b. Two specific group means can be said to be significantly different if:


the F statistic of the overall ANOVA is significant incorrect
one group mean is at least twice the value of another
a Tukey HSD pairwise comparison shows p < 0.05 (or the identified level of significance) correct

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

This analysis examined correct151 top-grossing ﬁlms produced by ﬁve major studios.

Analysis correctrevealed a diﬀerence in the number of days a ﬁlm spent in the theater, by studio (F(4,146)= correct5.354 , p<0.05). In a  correctTukey HSD test,  correctFox films stayed in the theater significantly longer (155 days) than both  correctUniversal (130 days) and Sony Studios (114 days). Sony studios was also significantly lower than  correctWarner Brothers studios (146 days).

An additional analysis  correctdid not reveal a significant difference in the percentage of earnings domestically, across the five different studios (F(4,146)=2.097, p=  correct0.084 .



## Problem Set

Question 1

Do low-budget movies make a different percentage of their profits domestically than movies with medium- or high-budgets? 

1. Suppose films with a budget less than $100 Million are considered "low-budget"; films with a budget of $100 million up to but not including 150 Million are considered "medium-budget", and those with a budget of $150 million or more are "high-budget."  

2. Create a new categorical variable in the dataset that defines each film under these criteria.

3. Use this data to answer the following questions.

Use the "FilmData.csv" dataset to answer the following questions.  Instructions for installing "FilmData.csv" can be found under the Examine the Data unit in this week's Pre-Lab section.
```{r}
film$BudgetCat[film$Budget < 100] <- "Low-Budget"
film$BudgetCat[film$Budget >= 100 & film$Budget < 150] <- "Medium-Budget"
film$BudgetCat[film$Budget >= 150] <- "High-Budget"
