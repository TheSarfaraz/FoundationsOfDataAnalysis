Known as the “Live Music Capital of the World,” Austin, Texas is also home to the longest-running music series in American television history, Austin City Limits.  This dataset includes data on a sample of musicians that performed live on the PBS television series Austin City Limits over the last 10 years.  Data on each artist include measures of commercial popularity, such as the number of social media followers on Twitter or Facebook, and their success in winning a Grammy Music Award.


Primary Research Questions

1. Are there an equal number of male and female performers on Austin City Limits?
2. Are male performers just as likely to have had a Top 10 hit as female performers?

Reflect on the Method

Which method should we be using for this analysis and why?

3a. We will use a Chi Square Goodness of Fit test to check whether there were an equal number of male and female performers. Why?


We want to see if the distribution of a categorical variable matches a proposed distribution model. correct
We want to know if there is an association between two categorical variables.
3b. We will use a Chi Square Test of Independence to determine if male and female performers were equally likely to have had a Top 10 hit. Why?


We want to determine if there is an association between two categorical variables. correct
We want to compare the distribution of a categorical variable to a proposed distribution model.


Primary Research Questions

1. Are there an equal number of male and female performers on Austin City Limits?
2. Are male performers just as likely to have had a Top 10 hit as female performers?

Breakdown Your Analysis

Let's break this analysis into its required steps:

Goodness of Fit Test:
1. Make a table of counts for gender.
2. Create a vector of the expected proportions.
3. Check the expected counts assumption.
4. Run the chi square test.
5. Interpret the chi square statistic and p-value.

Test of Independence:
1. Create a two-way table for gender and Top 10 hits.
2. Check the expected counts assumption.
3. Run the chi square test.
4. Interpret the chi square statistic and p-value.

Here is the code you will use:

Question 1 (Goodness of Fit)
```{r}
# Create a table of counts for Gender
gender_tab <-table(acl$Gender)
gender_tab

# Create vector of expected proportions
ExpGender <- c(.50, .50)

# Check expected counts assumption
chisq.test(gender_tab, p=ExpGender)$expected

# Run goodness of fit
chisq.test(gender_tab, p=ExpGender)
```

Question 2 (Test of Independence)
```{r}
# Create two-way table
gender_top10 <-table(acl$Gender, acl$BB.wk.top10)
gender_top10

# Generate expected counts
chisq.test(gender_top10, correct=FALSE)$expected

# Run test of independence
chisq.test(gender_top10, correct=FALSE)

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

First we examined whether there were an equal number of male and female artists on Austin City Limits. In our sample, there were 81  correctmales and 35  correctfemales . A chi square  correctgoodness of fit test showed that this difference  correctwas statistically significant (chi square=  correct18.24 df=1, p<.05). There are more correctmales than  correctfemales on the show. Second, we asked whether male and female artists were equally likely to have had a Top 10 hit. Approximately 55% of the  incorrectfemale artists had a Top 10 hit, and 46% of the incorrectmale artists had a Top 10 hit. This difference  correctwas not statistically significant. A chi square test of independence found top 10 hits to be  incorrectindependent of gender (chi square= 0.700, df=1, p=  correct0.403 ). The assumptions for each test  correctwere met.

Goodness of Fit Test:
1. Create a table to show the counts of each genre.
2. Create a vector of expected proportions.
3. Check the expected counts assumption.
4. Run a chi square test.
5. Interpret the chi square statistic and p-value.

Test of Independence:
1. Create a two-way table for genre and Twitter following.
2. Check the expected counts assumption.
3. Run a chi square test.
4. Interpret the chi square statistic and p-value.

chisq.test(genre_tab, p=ExpGenre)$expected

# Run goodness of fit
chisq.test(genre_tab, p=ExpGenre)
```

Question 2 (Test of Independence)
```{r}

3b. We should  correctfail to reject the hypothesis that genre is independent of Twitter followers.

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

First we examined whether genres were represented equally at Austin City Limits. In our sample, there were 18 country, 13 jazz/blues, 68 rock/folk/indie, and 17 singer/songwriter acts. A Chi-square  correctGoodness of Fit test showed that this difference correctwas statistically significant. (Chi-square= correct70.41 , df= correct3 , p<0.05). There is a higher representation of  incorrectrock/folk/indie artists than other artists on the show.

Second, we asked whether some genres were likely to draw more Twitter (over 100K). A Chi-square  correctTest of Independence revealed that there was no significant finding--a large Twitter following was correctindependent of genre (Chi-square= correct5.69 , df= correct3 , p-value=0.1276).


## Problem Set

Question 1

You want to know if the proportion of female performers on Austin City Limits Live has changed in the past two years. 

1. Create a new variable in the dataset called "Recent" that is equal to a 1 for rows from years 2012 or 2013 and is equal to 0 for all other rows.

2. Make a table that shows the number of male and female performers in "recent" and non-recent years.

3. Use this data to answer the following questions.

Use the "AustinCityLimits.csv" dataset to answer the following questions.  Instructions for installing "AustinCityLimits.csv" can be found under the Examine the Data unit in this week's Pre-Lab section.

You'll need to use the following code to help:
`acl$Recent[acl$Year < 2012] <- 0 `
`acl$Recent[acl$Year >= 2012] <- 1`
```{r}
acl$Recent[acl$Year < 2012] <- 0
acl$Recent[acl$Year >= 2012] <- 1
