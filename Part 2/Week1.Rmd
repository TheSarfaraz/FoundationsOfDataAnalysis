# Pre-Lab 1: UT Student Survey Data

In this lab, we will examine how sample data can be used to discover the truth about a population.  Our population data consists of data we collected from our statistics students here at The University of Texas at Austin.   They told us several things about themselves, including how happy they are and the amount of time they study.  We'll run a few simulations on this data to see if we can replicate what the Central Limit Theorem tells us about sampling. We are pretending that we don't know the "true" population parameters, but in fact we do!

Primary Research Question

How many letters long is the typical UT student’s name?  How does our estimate change as we increase the size of our sample?

Breakdown Your Analysis

Let's break this analysis into its required steps:

Determine the population parameters:
1. Visualize the shape of the population data by making a histogram.  
2. Calculate the “true” mean and standard deviation of the population.


Compare the sample statistics:  
3. Draw 1,000 samples of size n=5 from the population data.  Calculate the mean of each sample. 
4. Graph these 1,000 sample means in a histogram and examine the shape.
5. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution.
6. Repeat this process for samples of size n=15 and n=25.
7. Compare the results you get to the predictions of the Central Limit Theorem.

Here is the code you will use:
```{r}
# Calculate the population parameters
hist(survey$name_letters)
fivenum(survey$name_letters)
mean(survey$name_letters)
sd(survey$name_letters)


# Draw 1,000 samples of n=5 and find the mean of each sample.
xbar5 <-rep(NA, 1000)
for (i in 1:1000)
{x <-sample(survey$name_letters, size =5)
xbar5[i] <-  mean(x)}


# Graph the histogram of 1,000 sample means.
hist(xbar5,xlim=c(2,10))

 
# Calculate the mean and sd of the sampling distribution.
mean(xbar5)
sd(xbar5)

# Compare to the std dev predicted by the CTL.
sd(survey$name_letters)/sqrt(5)

 
#Repeat for samples of size n=15
xbar15 <-rep(NA, 1000)
for (i in 1:1000)
{x <-sample(survey$name_letters, size =15)
xbar15[i] <- mean(x)}
hist(xbar15,xlim=c(2,10))
mean(xbar15)
sd(xbar15)
sd(survey$name_letters)/sqrt(15)

 
#Repeat for samples of size n=25
xbar25 <-rep(NA, 1000)
for (i in 1:1000)
{x <-sample(survey$name_letters, size =25)
xbar25[i] <- mean(x)}
hist(xbar25,xlim=c(2,10))
mean(xbar25)
sd(xbar25)
sd(survey$name_letters)/sqrt(25)
```

Focus on this portion of the code in order to answer the following questions:

x is a sample of 5 data values drawn from the population correct
1b) What is mean(x)?


It is the mean of all the values in the population.
It is the mean of the 5 data points drawn in each sample. correct
It is the mean of 5 sample means.

3) We used the following code to try to show the sampling distribution of ages:

```
xbar5 <-rep(NA, 1000)
for (i in 1:1000)
{x <-sample(survey$age, size =5)
xbar5[i] <- mean(x)}
hist(xbar5,xlim=c(2,10))
```

Why was the histogram that R produced blank?


The xbar5 vector (of sample means) is empty.
Since we are taking random samples, it is not unusual to have this histogram.
The scale of the x-axis is set from 2 to 10, but the ages are not in this range. correct
The sample size in line 4 needs to be 1000 to match the previous lines.

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

In this lab, we knew the average name length for our population of college students. The population mean was correct5.97 letters and the standard deviation was  correct1.49 . The name lengths were correctNormally distributed . 

We drew samples of different sizes from our population to simulate the Central Limit Theorem. In short, the CLT says three things:

1. As sample size increases, sampling distributions become more  correctNormal .
2. The mean of the sampling distribution will be the correctpopulation mean . 
3. The variability of the sample means can be predicted by dividing the population  correctstandard deviation by the square root of correctthe sample size .

Our simulation results were consistent with this theory. As we increased the size of our sample from 5 to 25, the sample means become correctless variable and tended to cluster correctmore tightly around the correcttrue mean . In other words, our sample means became correctbetter estimators of the true population mean.

Review of the Central Limit Theorem

In this lab, you will use a simulation to better understand the Central Limit Theorem. Let's start by remembering the key features of the Central Limit Theorem.

1a) In this lab, we will draw samples to answer the following question: What percentage of the time are college students happy? How does the Central Limit Theorem predict our answer to this question will change as sample size increases?


As sample size increases, our sample means should become less variable and be closer to the true mean. correct
Increasing sample size will have no impact on the value of our sample means.
As sample size increases, the sample means we draw will all be equal to the population mean.
As sample size increases, our sample means should become more variable and less accurate estimators.
1b) What does it mean to increase the sample size in a simulation?


It means to run more iterations on the data.
It means to draw more individuals in each of our samples. correct
It means to draw from a larger population.
It means to draw more samples from our population.
1c) What should be true about our sampling distributions as we increase our sample size?


The means should decrease and the standard errors should remain about the same.
The means and the standard errors should increase.
The means and the standard errors should decrease.
The means should remain about the same, but the standard errors should decrease. correct
