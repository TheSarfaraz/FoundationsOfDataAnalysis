# Pre-Lab 3: Post Student-Survey Data
![](https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/assets/courseware/v1/7ad6d99716a958ec78982194cb6704e4/asset-v1:UTAustinX+UT.7.21x+2T2017+type@asset+block/student.jpg)
Students at The University of Texas at Austin answered a set of questions for us at the beginning of the semester and then again at the end.  We'll use this data to compare different groups, and to explore what has (or has not) changed over time for these students. (Please note that in the United States, the labels of "freshmen," "sophomore," "junior," and "senior" designate whether a student at a four-year university or college is in their first, second, third, or fourth year respectively.)  

Primary Research Questions

1.  Who is happier at the beginning of the semester:  under-classmen or upper-classmen?
2.  Does student happiness change from the beginning of the semester to the end?

Check the Data

Let's begin by examining our data in R.

1. Open RStudio. Make sure you've installed the SDSFoundations package.
2. Type library(SDSFoundations). This will automatically load the data for the labs. 
3.Type post <- PostSurvey. This will assign the data to your Workspace. 
4. Look at the spreadsheet view of the data to answer the following questions.

Alternatively, you can follow the steps in the "Importing a Data Frame" R tutorial video, and use the PostSurvey.csv file. (Right-click and "Save As.") Make sure to name the dataframe "post" when importing.

1. Open RStudio.
2. Click on the "Import Dataset" button at the top of the workspace window. Choose "from text file."
3. Click on the location of the PostSurvey.csv file you just downloaded.
4. Click on the PostSurvey.csv file. Then, click Upload.
5. Look at the spreadsheet view of the data to answer the following questions.
```{r}

The variable name in the dataset is  correctclassification , which is a  correctcategorical variable.

2b. Which variable tells us how happy students were at the beginning of the semester?

The variable name in the dataset is  correcthappy , which is a  correctquantitative variable.

2c. Which variable tells us how happy students were at the end of the semester?

Reflect on the Method

Which method should we be using for this analysis and why?

3a. We will use an independent t-test to help us compare the happiness of the under and upper-classmen. Why?


We are comparing two means, so it must be an independent t-test.
We want to see the change in happiness as students go from freshman to senior year.
We want to determine if there is any kind of relationship between lower and upperclassmen.
We want to compare the happiness of two different populations of students. correct
3b. We will use a dependent t-test to help us determine whether happiness levels changed over the semester. Why?


We want to see the change in happiness as students go from freshman to senior year.
We are looking for a change over time for the same group of students. correct
We want to determine if happiness is dependent on what month of the year it is.
We are looking at a difference between means, so it must be a dependent t-test.

Primary Research Questions

1.  Who is happier at the beginning of the semester:  under-classmen or upper-classmen?
2.  Does student happiness change from the beginning of the semester to the end?

Breakdown Your Analysis

Let's break this analysis into its required steps:

Question 1:  Independent t-test
1. Make a vector of happiness scores for each sample (under- and upper-classmen).
2. Generate histograms to check the Normality assumption. 
3. Run an independent t-test.
4. Interpret the results.

Question 2:  Dependent t-test
1. Make a vector of difference scores for student happiness from the beginning to the end of semester.
2. Generate a histogram of the difference scores to check the Normality assumption.
3. Run a dependent t-test.
4. Interpret the results.

Here is the code you will use:

Lab Question 1
```{r}
# Make a vector of happiness scores for each sample
underclass_happy <- post$happy[post$classification=='Freshman'|post$classification=='Sophomore']
upperclass_happy <- post$happy[post$classification=='Junior'|post$classification=='Senior']

# Check the normality assumption
hist(underclass_happy, xlab='Underclassman Happiness', main='Percent of Time Happy')
hist(upperclass_happy, xlab='Upperclassman Happiness', main='Percent of Time Happy')

# Run independent t-test
t.test(underclass_happy, upperclass_happy)
```

#Lab Question 2
```{r}
# Make a vector of difference scores
post$diff_happy <- post$happy - post$post_happy

# Check the normality assumption
hist(post$diff_happy, xlab= 'Difference in Happiness over the Semester', main = 'Happy-Post Happy')

# Run dependent t-test
t.test(post$happy, post$post_happy, paired=T)
```

Write Your Conclusion

Answer the question and support your answer with statistics:

The average happiness scores for under-classmen (79.7%) and upper-classmen (78.3%)  correctwere not found to be significantly different (t=  correct0.423 , p = 0.675). The distribution of scores for each group were  correctnegatively skewed. However, the sample sizes were both sufficiently large to meet the assumption for Normality. Over the semester, student happiness correctdecreased by an average of 1.27%. This  correctwas not a statistically significant change (t= correct1.684 p=.094). Overall, there  correctdoes not appear to be any significant difference in levels of student happiness based on their year in college, or the time of the semester.

We'll use this data to compare different groups, and to explore what has (or has not) changed over time for these students. Please note that in the United States, college and university students may choose to participate in social clubs called "sororities" and "fraternities." These social clubs are known as "Greek" clubs.

Review of Two-Sample t-Tests

In this lab, you will use two-sample t-tests to answer a question of interest. Let's start by remembering why we use these hypothesis tests.

Two samples are considered dependent when:


each score in one sample is paired with a specific score in the other sample. correct
the variables of interest are both measures of time.
we expect the difference to be statistically significant.
the subjects have not been randomly assigned.
Two samples are considered independent when:


there is no statistically significant difference between the means of both samples.
the scores are recorded without measurement error.
the scores of one sample do not affect the scores of the other sample. correct
the subjects are being measured on variables that are time-dependent.

Primary Research Questions

1. Do students at UT spend more time on homework per week in college than they did in high school?
2. Do students in fraternities and sororities get less sleep on the weekends than other college students?

Analysis

Let’s break this question down into the different statistics that you will need to construct your answer.  Be sure that your R output includes all of the following components. 

For each hypothesis test, 

1. Create vectors of the scores that you wish to analyze.
2. Check the assumption of normality by generating a histogram for each variable of interest. 
3. Find the t-statistic and p-value.
4. Interpret the results of each test. 


NOTE:  If you are running directional hypotheses tests, remember that you must modify the code to reflect this direction.
A one-sided test looks like this:   

`t.test(Variable1, Variable2, alternative = 'less'), when you expect Mean1 < Mean2`
`t.test(Variable1, Variable2, alternative = 'greater'), when you expect Mean1 > Mean2`
```{r}
post$diff_hw <- post$hw_hours_college - post$hw_hours_HS
hist(post$diff_hw)
mean(post$diff_hw)

t.test(post$diff_hw)
